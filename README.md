# Orbital Witness Technical Task

This document contains instructions for candidates to follow as part of the Orbital Witness Technical Assessment. We look forward to your submission.

# Objective
At Orbital Witness, we deal with a variety of data formats and structures. One of them is data on [titles](https://eservices.landregistry.gov.uk/eservices/FindAProperty/view/resources/example_register.pdf) from the Land Registry. In this assessment, we have provided an analogue of what we usually deal with on a day-to-day basis.

## User Story
**AS A** user of the app you create **I WANT** to browse through an extensive list of Land registry titles **SO THAT** I can efficiently look through the details of each title and favourite them.

# Instructions
To complete the task you need to create an app based on [these wireframes](https://github.com/orbitalwitness/tech-test/tree/main/wireframes).

## Functionality
App fetches [the JSON data about titles we‚Äôve provided to you](https://github.com/orbitalwitness/tech-test/tree/main/data). It‚Äôs formatted like:

```
[
    {
        "id":"0",
        "titleNumber":"MYBKZ10625",
        "titleClass":"Freehold",
        "isFavorite":true,
        "content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean convallis lectus velit, ac mollis lorem fringilla ac. In consequat molestie dui, et pellentesque nisl convallis at. Curabitur dictum lacinia justo, pulvinar pharetra purus ru"
    },
    {
        "id":"1",
        "titleNumber":"GP51",
        "titleClass":"Leasehold",
        "isFavorite":true,
        "content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean convallis lectus velit, ac mollis lorem fringilla ac. In consequa"
    },
]
```

It has a single page: titles.

## Titles page

<details>
<summary>Show wireframes</summary>
<p>

#### List of titles and title details

![Titles page](wireframes/Titles%20page.png)

#### Dropdown filter

![Titles page - dropdown](wireframes/Titles%20page%20-%20dropdown.png)

</p>
</details>

 - This page contains a table of titles. It must be paginated and you should display 20 titles on every page. **Be careful with the URL**, you'll want to stay on page 6 when you refresh the page.
 - Hovering over a row turns it grey and click on it opens the titles details to the right. A selected title‚Äôs row should remain grey. **This is only a requirement on desktop**; on mobile you should just add a title to the favorites.
 - Clicking on the star in each title details makes the title a favorite (and turns the star purple).
 - On click of the table header cell ‚ÄúClass of title‚Äù, a dropdown should open with two checkboxes. They should filter Freehold/Leasehold classes.
 - On click of the table header cell ‚ÄúTitle number‚Äù, you should sort the titles ascending (A-Z). First click sorts it ascending, second click sorts it descending and a third click sorts it back to ascending.


## What you should focus on
- Obviously, this needs to be done with React (and Typescript). Use the best patterns you know here, and don‚Äôt hack anything just because it‚Äôs a small app. Imagine that you‚Äôre creating a new feature for your commercial project.
- Let us know in the README how we can start the app.
- Margins and paddings don‚Äôt have to be the same as shown in the wireframes. However, they should all be divisible by 4. Use your common sense when deciding about their exact values across the app. Same goes with the font sizes.
- CLEAN CODE! **You don‚Äôt need to implement everything, but whatever you do implement should showcase your best work**.
- Responsive design! Care about widths from 375px to 1280px. It should look appropriate on all of those widths.
- We love automated tests as well :)
- Please don‚Äôt use any UI frameworks (like material-UI); build everything in pure HTML and CSS/SCSS/CSS-in-JS, whatever suits you the best.
- We don‚Äôt care about the icons, but they should be consistent across the app. Possible use https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons? Again, whatever source you have is fine.

## Finally

Good luck and have fun with this task! üöÄ
